### Project Title
Exploring bikesharing data in 3 cities in the US

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to 
bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago,
New York City, and Washington. I wrote the code to import the data and 
answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an 
interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
chicago.csv
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv
